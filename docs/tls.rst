TLS/wss Support
===============

Your Router must be configured to use TLS. For an example see the `config`_ used by the test runner along with the `TLS Router`_ setup.

To connect a Client over TLS you must provide a connection URL using the ``wss`` protocol and your **Router** probably will require you to provide a certificate for authorisation.

::

    In [1]: from wampy.peers import Client

    In [2]: client = Client(url="wss://...", cert_path="./...")

Add parameter ``cert_check=False`` to Client if you don't want the client to validate server certificate.
